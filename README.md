# Alpine-Elixir-Phoenix_DevContainer-Config
Configuration files for an Alpine Linux based dev container, for Elixir/Phoenix framework development. Using the base Alpine dev container [image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/devcontainers/base/about), a Dockerfile to install Elixir, Phoenix framework, and their dependencies, and docker-compose to bring postgresql into the mix.

More details to come, as this repo gets fleshed out.

## Acknowlegements and Thanks:
All of this was made possible by the dev container folks (check them out at their [github](https://github.com/devcontainers) 
 or [website](https://containers.dev/)). In particular their [guide](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile) on creating dev containers using images, dockerfiles, and docker compose was incredibly useful. This dev container config was made standing on their shoulders.
